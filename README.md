## Usage

Experiments were made in **python 3.7**.
To reproduce the analysis made, create a virtual environment and install required packages, then run the script directly. All results will be saved to `./output` directory.

```bash
conda create --name aer-env python=3.7
conda activate aer-env
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
